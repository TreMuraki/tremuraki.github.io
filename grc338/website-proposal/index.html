            <p>In 2015, Gioia breathed life into the original Trattoria Gioia in Sacramento. What started as a family run deli has since revitalized into the well known Trattoria Gioia. Much beloved by locals and travelers alike, Gioia was an early adopter of the farm-to-fork philosophy. With over 65+ years of experience Gioia, along with the rest of the family, offer a unique take on Italian cuisine.

                        A timeless Italian culinary experience for this moment.
                        
                        Glittering chandeliers float below wooden farm beams. Wisps of fragrant smoke linger inside a gold-plated pizza oven. Sumptuous fabrics meet impeccable ingredients.
                        
                        This is Trattoria Gioia, the latest hospitality venture from the award-winning team behind Unconventional Diner. The restaurant reflects the glorious contrasts of Italy itself: haute yet simple; glam yet rustic; indulgent yet restrained. Above all, it’s a destination Sacramento deserves right now, a Mediterranean balm in the heart of the capital.

                <h1> About us </h1>
            
                <p>   Trattoria Gioia is a charming Italian restaurant located next to Sacramento’s Tower Cafe. We offer a full selection of fresh pastas, raviolis, pasta sauces, meats, seafood, Italian imported goods, and wine. Our award winning deli offers take out or dine in. A special eight course dinner is served every Friday (reservation only).
 
                    At Gioia’s you'll receive the kind of service you might have gotten 75 years ago in a small Tuscan village. Homemade Italian sides & entrees can be found in the deli case along with sausages made fresh in the Italian tradition with a hand-grinder that dates back to 1893. </p>
