                            <h2>What is Business Core Fashion?</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I hear someone ask me to name a shortcut to success in the fashion business, I say this: ‘Have consistent information in your brand that’s connected and harmonized in a way that allows you to communicate with customers and suppliers.’
You know, today people think that in order to be successful in the fashion industry, all you need to do is come up with original concepts from clothing and have a great team of marketing professionals.</p>

                                <p>While these two things are essential, you won’t get far if you don’t have a consistent and harmonized campaign across your brand. That’s because you want to have a long-lasting influence and effect on consumers.</p>

                                <p>Look at Chanel, Louis Vuitton and other major fashion brands. Why are they so successful today? Because in addition to making remarkable clothes and marketing their items smart, they’re able to communicate with their customers by staying loyal to their business strategies.</p>

                                <p>You know, many fashion brands make that common mistake when they trade their products under different names and have different styles when cataloguing their items. But that’s only half of the problem, as they are also communicating with their customers in different ways.</p>

                                <p>I’ve witnessed many fashion brands adopt new business strategies and rise from average brands to major, world-recognizable fashion brands. And the most successful business strategies have one notable thing in common: consistency.
                                    Consistency and harmony in the information you provide to your customers. Harmonized communication with customers and collaboration with suppliers as well as consistent ties with your associates…
                                    All these factors are an important addition to make products that are always consistent with your brand’s overall style as well as staying loyal to your business path.</p>

                                    A lot of modern Corporate visuals will draw loosely from the Cyberprep aesthetic (unless you're the CEO, where Boujee is almost undoubtedly the aesthetic of choice for you) in the sense it's very safe...
