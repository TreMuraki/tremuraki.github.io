<p>Every time I hear someone ask me to name a shortcut to success in the fashion business, I say this: ‘Have consistent information in your brand that’s connected and harmonized in a way that allows you to communicate with customers and suppliers.’
    You know, today people think that in order to be successful in the fashion industry, all you need to do is come up with original concepts from clothing and have a great team of marketing professionals. 
    While these two things are essential, you won’t get far if you don’t have a consistent and harmonized campaign across your brand. That’s because you want to have a long-lasting influence and effect on consumers.</p>

                                    A lot of modern Corporate visuals will draw loosely from the Cyberprep aesthetic (unless you're the CEO, where Boujee is almost undoubtedly the aesthetic of choice for you) in the sense it's very safe...
